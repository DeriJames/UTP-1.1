.chapter 3 "Learning  \f[CB]vi\fP" "Chapter" 1
.ix %begin [vi] editor %key vi editor
.LP
UNIX has a number of editors that can process the contents of readable files,
whether those files contain data, source code, or text.
There are line editors,
such as
.CW ed
and
.CW ex ,
which display a line of the file on the screen,
and there are screen editors,
such as
.CW vi
and
.CW emacs ,
.ix [emacs] editor %key emacs editor
which display a part of the file on your terminal screen.
.PP
The most useful standard text editor on your system is
.CW vi .
Unlike
.CW emacs,
it is available in nearly identical form
on almost every UNIX system,
thus providing a kind of text editing
.I "lingua franca" .
The same might be said of
.CW ed
and
.CW ex ,
but screen editors are generally much easier to use.
With a screen editor you can scroll the page,
move the cursor, delete lines, insert characters, and more,
while seeing the results of your edits as you make them.
Screen editors are very popular
because they allow you to make changes as you read a file,
much as you would edit a printed copy,
only faster.
.PP
To many beginners,
.CW vi
looks unintuitive and cumbersome\c
\(em\&instead of letting you type normally
and use special control keys for word-processing functions,
it uses all of the regular keyboard keys for issuing commands.
You must be in a special
.I "insert mode
.ix [vi] editor, insert mode %key vi editor, insert mode
before you can type.
In addition, there seem to be
.I "so many
commands.
.PP
You can't learn
.CW vi
by memorizing every single
.CW vi
command.
Begin by learning some basic commands.
As you do, be aware of the patterns of usage
that commands have in common.
Be on the lookout for new ways to perform tasks,
experimenting with new commands and combinations of commands.
.PP
As you become more familiar with
.CW vi ,
you will find that you need fewer keystrokes
to tell
.CW vi
what to do.
You will learn shortcuts that transfer more and more
of the editing work to the computer\c
\(em\&where it belongs.
Not as much memorization is required
as first appears from a list of
.CW vi
commands.
Like any skill,
the more editing you do, the more you know about it
and the more you can accomplish.
.PP
This chapter has three sections,
and each one corresponds to a set of material about
.CW vi
that you should be able to tackle in a single session.
After you have finished each session,
put aside the book for a while and do some experimenting.
When you feel comfortable with what you have learned,
continue to the next session.
.Ah "Session 1: Basic Commands
.LP
The first session contains the basic knowledge
you need to operate the
.CW vi
editor.
After a general description of
.CW vi ,
you are shown some simple operations.
You will learn how to
.RS
.Ls B
.Li
open and close a file;
.Li
give commands and insert text;
.Li
move the cursor;
.Li
edit text (change, delete, and copy).
.Le
.RE
You can use
.CW vi
to edit any file
that contains readable text,
whether it is a report,
a series of shell commands,
or a program.
The
.CW vi
editor
copies the file to be edited into a buffer
(an area temporarily set aside in memory),
displays as much of the buffer as possible on the screen,
and lets you add, delete, and move text.
When you save your edits,
.CW vi
copies the buffer into a permanent file,
overwriting the contents of
the old file.
.Ah "Opening a File
.ix %begin [vi] editor, opening~a file %key vi editor, opening a file
.LP
The syntax for the
.CW vi
command is:
.Ps
vi [\fIfilename\fP]
.Pe
where
.I filename
is the name of either
an existing file or a new file.
If you don't specify a filename,
.CW vi
will open an unnamed buffer,
and ask you to name it before you can save any edits you have made.
Press
.I RETURN
to execute the command.
.PP
A filename must be unique inside its directory.
.ix files, naming restrictions
On AT&T (System V) UNIX systems,
it cannot exceed 14 characters.
(Berkeley UNIX systems allow longer filenames).
A filename can include any ASCII character
except /,
which is reserved as the separator
between files and directories in a pathname.
You can even include spaces in a filename
by \(lqescaping\(rq them with a backslash.
In practice, though,
filenames consist of any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters,
numbers, and the characters
.CW \.
(dot) and
.CW _
(underscore).
Remember that UNIX is case-sensitive:
lowercase filenames are distinct from uppercase
filenames, and, by convention, lowercase is preferred.
.PP
If you want to open a new file called
.CW notes
in the current directory,
enter:
.Ps
$ \f[CB]vi notes\fP
.Pe
The
.CW vi
command clears the screen
and displays a new buffer for you to begin work.
Because
.CW notes
is a new file,
the screen displays a column of
.I tildes
(\c
.CW \(ap )
to indicate that there is no text in the file,
not even blank lines.

If you specify the name of a file that already exists,

might bring a copy of the existing file

.PP
Sometimes when you invoke
.CW vi ,
you may get either of the following messages:
.Ps
[using open mode]
.Pe
or:
.Ps
Visual needs addressable cursor or upline capability
.Pe
In both cases,
there is a problem identifying the type of terminal you are using.
You can quit the editing session immediately by typing
.CW :q .
.PP
Although
.CW vi
can run on almost any terminal,
it must know what kind of terminal you are using.
The terminal type is usually set as part of the UNIX login sequence.
If you are not sure whether your terminal type is defined correctly,
ask your system administrator
or an experienced user
to help you set up your terminal.
If you know your terminal type (\c
.CW wy50
for instance),
you can set your
.CW TERM
environment variable with the following command:
.Ps
TERM=wy50; export TERM
.Pe
.Bh "\f(CBvi\fP Commands
.LP
The
.CW vi
editor has two
.I modes :
command mode and insert mode.
.ix [vi] editor, command mode %key vi editor, command mode
Unlike many word
processors,
.CW vi 's
command mode is the initial or
.I default
mode.
To insert lines of text,
.ix [vi] editor, insert mode %key vi editor, insert mode
.ix [vi] editor, inserting text %key vi editor, inserting text
you must give a command to enter insert mode and then type away.
.PP
Most commands consist of one or two characters.
For example:
.RS
\f(CWi\fP         insert
.br
\f(CWc\fP         change
.RE
.PP
Using letters as commands, you can edit a file quickly.
You don't have to
memorize banks of function keys
or stretch your fingers to reach awkward combinations
of keys.
.PP
In general,
.ix [vi] editor, command~syntax %key vi editor, command syntax
.CW vi
commands
.RS
.Ls B
.Li
are case-sensitive
(uppercase and lowercase keystrokes mean different things;
e.g.,
.I I
is different from
.I i );
.Li
are not echoed on the screen;
.Li
do not require a
.I RETURN
after the command.
.Le
.RE
.PP
There is also a special group of commands
that echo on the bottom line of the screen.
Bottom-line commands are indicated by special symbols.
The slash (\c
.CW / )
and the question mark (\c
.CW ? )
begin search commands,
which are discussed in session 2.
A colon (\c
.CW : )
indicates an
.CW ex
.ix [ex] editor, executing~from [vi] %key ex editor, executing from [vi]
command.
You are introduced to one
.CW ex
command
(to quit a file without saving edits)
in this chapter,
and the
.CW ex
line editor is discussed in detail in Chapter 7.
.PP
To tell
.CW vi
that you want to begin insert mode,
press
.CW i .
Nothing appears on the screen,
but you can now type any text at the cursor.
To tell
.CW vi
.ix [vi] editor, leaving insert~mode %key vi editor, leaving insert mode
to stop inserting text,
press
.I ESC
and you will return to command mode.
.PP
For example, suppose that you want to insert the word
.I introduction .
If you type
the keystrokes
.CW iintroduction ,
what appears on the screen is
.Ps
introduction
.Pe
Because you are starting out in command mode,
.CW vi
interprets the first keystroke (\f(CWi\fP)
as the insert command.
All keystrokes after that result in characters placed in the file,
until you press
.I ESC .
If you need to correct a mistake while in insert mode,
backspace and type over the error.
.PP
While you are inserting text,
press
.I RETURN
to break the lines before the right margin.
An autowrap option provides a carriage return automatically
after you exceed the right margin.
To move the right margin in ten spaces,
for example, enter
.ix [vi] editor, wrapmargin %key vi editor, wrapmargin
.CW ":set wm=10" .
.PP
Sometimes you may not know if you are in insert mode or command mode.
Whenever
.CW vi
does not respond as you expect, press
.I ESC .
When you hear a beep, you are in command mode.
.Bh "Saving a File
.ix [vi] editor, saving~a file %key vi editor, saving a file
.LP
You can quit working on a file at any time,
save the edits,
and return to the UNIX prompt.
The
.CW vi
command to quit and save edits is
.CW ZZ .
(Note that
.CW ZZ
is capitalized).
.PP
Let's assume that you create a file called
.CW letter
to practice
.CW vi
commands
and that you type in 36 lines of text.
To save the file,
first check that you are in command mode by pressing
.I ESC ,
and then give the write and save command,
.CW ZZ .
Your file is saved as a regular file.
The result is:
.Ps
"letter"  [New file]  36 lines,  1331 characters
.Pe
You return to the UNIX prompt.
If you check the list of files in the directory,
by typing
.CW ls
at the prompt,
the new file is listed.
.Ps
$ \f[CB]ls\fP
ch01  ch02  letter
.Pe
You now know enough to create a new file.
As an exercise,
create a file called
.CW letter
and insert the text shown in Figure 3-1.
When you have finished,
type
.CW ZZ
to save the file and return to the UNIX prompt.
.Ah "Moving the Cursor
.ix [vi] editor, cursor~movement %key vi editor, cursor movement
.ix cursor movement
.LP
Only a small percentage of time in an editing session
may be spent adding new text in insert mode.
Much of the time,
you will be editing existing text.
.PP
In command mode,
you can position the cursor anywhere in the file.
You start all basic edits
(changing, deleting, and copying text)
by placing the cursor at the text
that you want to change.
Thus, you want to be able to quickly move the cursor to that
place.

Dear Mr. Fust:

In our conversation last Thursday, we discussed a
documentation project that would produce a user's
manual on the Alcuin product.  Yesterday, I received
the product demo and other materials that you sent me.

Going through a demo session gave me a much better
understanding of the product.  I confess to being
amazed by Alcuin.  Some people around here, looking
over my shoulder, were also astounded by the
illustrated manuscript I produced with Alcuin.  One
person, a student of calligraphy, was really impressed.

Today, I'll start putting together a written plan
that shows different strategies for documenting
the Alcuin product.  After I submit this plan, and
you have had time to review it, let's arrange a
meeting at your company to discuss these strategies.

Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to bid on
this documentation project.  I hope we can decide upon
a strategy and get started as soon as possible in order
to have the manual ready in time for the first customer
shipment.  I look forward to meeting with you towards
the end of next week.
                                        Sincerely,


                                        Fred Caslon

When you saved the file
.CW letter,
the editor displayed a message
telling you how many lines were in that file.
A
.I line
in the file is not necessarily the same length as a
physical line
(limited to 80 characters)
that appears on the screen.
A line is any text
entered between carriage returns.
If you type 200 characters before pressing
.I RETURN ,
.CW vi
regards all 200 characters as a single line
(even though those 200 characters
look like several physical lines on the screen).

Two useful commands in line movement are:
.RS
\f(CW0\fP <zero>		move to beginning of line

.Pe
You can also move forward one word at a time,
ignoring symbols and punctuation
marks,
using the command
.CW W
(note the uppercase
.I W ).
It causes the cursor to move to the first character
following a blank space.
Cursor movement using
.CW W
looks like this:
.Ps
\zm_ove \zt_he \zc_ursor,  \zd_elete \zl_ines, \za_nd \zi_nsert \zc_haracters,

.ix [vi] editor, on~a dumb~terminal %key vi editor, on a dumb~terminal
.ix terminal type
moves existing text to the right

That is because we are showing
.CW vi

which can adjust the screen with each character you type.
An insert on a \(lqdumb\(rq terminal
(such as an

will look different.
The terminal itself cannot update the screen
for each character typed
(without a tremendous sacrifice of speed),
so
.CW vi
doesn't rewrite the screen
until after you press
.I ESC .
Rather, when you type,
the dumb terminal appears to
overwrite the existing text.
When you press
.I ESC ,
the line is adjusted immediately so
that the missing characters reappear.
Thus, on a dumb terminal,
the same insert would
appear as follows:

To replace the entire current line,

The
.CW cc
command replaces the entire line of text,
regardless of where the cursor is located on the line.
.PP
The
.CW C
command replaces characters from the current cursor position
to the end of the line.
It has the same effect as combining

One other replacement edit is performed with the

This command replaces a single character with another single character.
One of its uses is to correct misspellings.
You probably don't want to use
.CW cw
in such an instance,
because you would have to retype the entire word.
Use
.CW r

You can delete by word (\c

by line (\c
.CW dd

.CW D ),
or by other movement commands that you will learn later.

With all deletions,
you move to where you want the edit to take p1ace

The
.CW dd
command deletes the entire line that the cursor is on.
Using the same text as in the previous example,
with the cursor positioned on the first line as shown,
you can delete the first two lines:
.ix %end [vi] editor, deleting single characters %key vi editor, deleting single characters
.LP 0
The
.CW X
command deletes the character before the cursor.
Prefix either of these commands with a number
to delete that number of characters.
For example,
.CW 5X
will delete the five characters to the left of the cursor.
.ix %end [vi] editor, deleting text %key vi editor, deleting text
.Bh "Moving Text
.ix [vi] editor, moving text %key vi editor, moving text
.LP 0
You can move text by deleting it
and then placing that deleted text elsewhere in the file,
like a \(lqcut and paste.\(rq
Each time you delete a text block,
that deletion is temporarily saved in a buffer.
You can move to another position in the file
and use the
.CW put
command
to place the text in a new position.
Although you can move any block of text,
this command sequence is more useful with lines than with words.
.PP
The put command,
.CW p ,
places saved or deleted text
(in the buffer)
.I after
the cursor position.
The uppercase version of the command,
.CW P ,
puts the text
.I before
the cursor.
If you delete one or more lines,
.CW p
puts the deleted text on a new line(s) below the cursor.
If you delete a word,
.CW p
puts the deleted text on the same line after the cursor.
.PP
Suppose that in your file
.CW letter
you have the following lines
and you want to
move the fourth line of text.
Using delete,
you can make this edit.
First delete the line in question:

You can also use
.CW xp
(delete character and put after cursor)
to transpose two letters.
For example, in the word
.I mvoe ,
the letters
.I vo
are transposed (reversed).
To correct this,
place the cursor on
.I v
and press
.CW x
then
.CW p .
.PP
After you delete the text,
you must restore it
before the next change or delete command.
If you make another edit that affects the buffer,
your deleted text will be lost.
You can repeat the put command over and over,
as long as you don't make a new edit.
In the advanced
.CW vi
chapter,
you will learn how to retrieve text from named
and numbered buffers.
.Bh "Copying Text
.ix [vi] editor, copying text %key vi editor, copying text
.LP
Often, you can save editing time
(and keystrokes)
by copying part of your file to another place.
You can copy any amount of existing text
and place that copied text elsewhere
in the file
with the two commands
.CW y
(\c
.I yank )
and
.CW p
(\c
.I put ).
The yank command is used to get a copy of text into the buffer
without altering the original text.
This copy can then be placed elsewhere in the file
with the put command.
.PP
Yank can be combined with any movement command
(for example,
.CW yw ,
.CW y$ ,
or
.CW 4yy ).
Yank is most frequently used with a line
(or more)
of text,
because to yank and put a word
generally takes longer than simply inserting the word.
For example, to yank five lines of text:
.sp .7v
.ne 8

The yanked text will appear

Deleting uses the same buffer as yanking.
Delete and put can be used in much the same way as yank and put.
Each new deletion or yank
replaces the previous contents of the yank buffer.
As we'll see later,
up to nine previous yanks or deletions
can be recalled with put commands.

Each command that you give
is stored in a temporary buffer
until you give the next command.
If you insert
.I the

the command used to insert the text,
along with the text that you entered,
is temporarily saved.
Anytime you are making the same editing command repeatedly,
you can save time by duplicating the command with
.CW \.
(dot).
To duplicate a command,
position the cursor anywhere on the screen,
and press
.CW \.
to repeat your last command
(such as an insertion or deletion)
in the buffer.
You can also use numeric arguments
(as in

to repeat the previous command more than once.

When you are first learning
.CW vi ,
especially if you are an intrepid experimenter,
there is one other command that is handy
for getting out of any mess that you might create.
You already know how to save your edits with
.CW ZZ ,
but what if you want to wipe out all the edits
you have made in a session and return to the original file?
.PP
You can quit
.CW vi
without saving edits
with a special bottom-line command
based on the
.CW ex
line editor.
The
.CW ex
commands are explained fully in the advanced
.CW vi
chapter,
but for basic
.CW vi
editing you should just memorize this command:
.Ps
:q!   <RETURN>
.Pe
The
.CW q!
command quits the file you are in.
All edits made since the last time you saved the file are lost.
.PP
You can get by in
.CW vi
using only the commands you have learned in this session.
However, to harness the real power of
.CW vi
(and increase your own productivity)
you will want to continue to the next session.
.Ah "Session 2: Moving Around in a Hurry

You use
.CW vi
not only to create new files
but also to edit existing files.

.Ah "Movement by Line Numbers
.LP 0
A file contains sequentially numbered lines,
and you can move through a file by specifying line numbers.
Line numbers are useful for identifying the beginning
and end of large blocks of text
you want to edit.
Line numbers are also useful for programmers
because compiler error messages refer to line numbers.
Line numbers are also used by
.CW ex
commands, as you will learn in Chapter 7.
.ix [vi] editor, displaying line~numbers %key vi editor, displaying line numbers
.PP
If you are going to move by line numbers,
you need a way to identify line numbers.
Line numbers can be displayed on the screen using the
.ix [vi] editor, movement~by line~number %key vi editor, movement by line~number
.CW :set
.CW  nu
option described in Chapter 7.
In
.CW vi ,
you can also display the current line number on the bottom of the screen.
.PP
The command
.CW ^G
displays the following on the bottom of your screen:
the current line number,
the total number of lines in the file,
and what percentage of the total
the present line number represents.
For example, for the file
.CW letter ,
.CW ^G
might display:
.Ps
"letter" line 10 of 40  --25%--
.Pe
.LP
.CW ^G
is used to display the line number to use in a command,
or to orient yourself
if you have been distracted from your editing session.
.PP
The
.CW G
(\c
.I "go to" )
command uses a line number as a numeric argument,
and moves to the first position on that line.
For instance,
.CW 44G
moves the cursor to the beginning of line 44.
The
.CW G
command without a line number
moves the cursor to the last line of the file.
.ix [vi] editor, returning~to~a position %key vi editor, returning to~a position

Two single quotes (\c

return you to your original position exactly.
If you have issued a search command
(\c
.CW /
or
.CW ? ),
.CW ``
will return the cursor
to its position when you started the search.
.PP
The total number of lines shown with
.CW ^G
can be used to give yourself a rough idea
of how many lines to move.
If you are on line 10 of a 1000-line file:
.Ps

with your first movement by search or by line number.
For example:

(You might want to call in a lengthy file to practice
.CW vi
movements,
or you might want to scroll through a command file or program).
If you enter a file in read-only mode,
you can use all the

.Bh "Recovering a Buffer
.LP 0
Occasionally, there will be a system failure
while you are editing a file.
Ordinarily, any edits made after your last write (save) are lost.
However, there is an option,
.CW -r ,
which lets you recover the edited buffer at the time of a system crash.
(A system program called
.CW preserve
saves the buffer as the system is going down).
.PP
When you first log in after the system is running again,
you will receive a mail message stating that your buffer is saved.
The first time that you call in the file,
use the
.CW -r
option to recover the edited buffer.
For example, to recover the edited buffer of the file
.CW letter
after a system crash, enter:
.Ps
$ \f(CBvi -r letter\fP
.Pe
If you first call in the file
.I without
using the
.CW -r
option, your buffered edits are lost.
.PP
You can force the system to preserve your buffer
even when there is not a crash
by using the command
.CW :pre .
You may find this useful
if you have made edits to a file,
then discover you can't save your edits
because you don't have write permission.
(You could also just write a copy of the file out
under another name
or in a directory where you do have write permission.)
.Ah "Customizing \f[CB]vi\fP"
.ix customizing [vi] %key customizing vi
.LP 0
A number of options that you can set as part of your editing environment
affect how
.ix %begin [vi] editor, setting options %key vi editor, setting options
.CW vi
operates.
For example,
you can set a right margin
that will cause
.CW vi
to wrap lines automatically,
so you don't need to insert carriage returns.
.PP
You can change options from within
.CW vi
by using the
.CW :set
command.
In addition,
.CW vi
reads an initialization file in your home directory
called
.ix [.exrc] file %key exrc file
.ix [ex] editor, [.exrc] file %key ex editor, [.exrc] file
.CW .exrc
for further operating instructions.
By placing
.CW set
commands in this file,
you can modify the way
.CW vi
acts whenever you use it.
.PP
You can also set up
.CW .exrc
files in local directories
to initialize various options
that you want to use in different environments.
For example, you might define one set of options for editing text,
but another set for editing source programs.
The
.CW .exrc
file in your home directory will be executed first,
then the one on your current directory.

(with the Bourne shell
.ix Bourne shell, [export] command %key Bourne shell, export command
.ix [export] command %key export command
.CW export

will be executed by

it will be used instead of
.CW \&.exrc ;
.CW vi
will not take commands from both.
.Bh "The \f[CB]set\fP Command

There are two types of options
that can be changed with the
.CW set
command:
toggle options,
which are either on or off,
and options that take a numeric or string value
(such as the location of a margin or the name of a file).
.PP
Toggle options may be on or off by default.
To turn a toggle option on, the command is:
.Ps
:set \fIoption\fP
.Pe
To turn a toggle option off, the command is:
.Ps
:set no\fIoption\fP
.Pe
For example, to specify that pattern searches should ignore case, you type:
.ix [vi] editor, ignoring case~during searches %key vi editor, ignoring case during searches
.Ps
:set ic
.Pe
If you want
.CW vi
to return to being case-sensitive in searches, give the command:
.Ps
:set noic
.Pe
.PP
Some options have values.
For example, the option
.CW window
sets the number of lines
shown in the screen \(lqwindow.\(rq
You set values for these options with an equals sign (\(eq). For example:
.ix [vi] editor, size~of window %key vi editor, size of window
.Ps
:set window=20
.Pe
During a
.CW vi
session, you can check what options are available.
The command:
.Ps

displays the complete list of options,
including options that you have set
and defaults that
.CW vi
has chosen.

A sample
.CW \&.exrc

.Pe
Because the file is actually read by

should not have a preceding colon.
.Bh "Alternate Environments
.LP 0
You can define alternate
.CW vi
environments by saving option settings in an
.CW \&.exrc
file that is placed in a local directory.
If you enter
.CW vi
from that directory,
the local
.CW \&.exrc
file will be read in.
If it does not exist,
the one in your home directory will be read in.
.PP
For example, you might want to have one set of options for programming:
.Ps
set number lisp autoindent sw=4 tags=/usr/lib/tags terse
.Pe
and another set of options for text editing:
.Ps
set wrapmargin=15  ignorecase
.Pe
Local
.CW \&.exrc
files are especially useful
when you define abbreviations, which are described in Chapter 7.
.Bh "Some Useful Options
.LP 0
As you can see when you type
.CW ":set all" ,
there are many options.
Most options are used internally by
.CW vi
and aren't usually changed.
Others are important in certain cases,
but not in others
(for example,
.CW noredraw
and
.CW window
can be useful on a dialup line at a low baud rate).
Appendix A contains a brief description of each option.
We recommend that you take some time
to play with option setting\(emif an option looks interesting,
try setting it
(or unsetting it)
and watch what happens while you edit.
You may find some surprisingly useful tools.
.ix [vi] editor, wrapmargin %key vi editor, wrapmargin
.PP
There is one option that is almost essential for editing
nonprogram text.
The
.CW wrapmargin
option specifies the size of the right margin
that will be used to autowrap text as you type.
(This saves manually typing carriage returns).
This option is in effect if its value is set to greater than 0.
A typical value is 10 or l5.
.Ps
set wrapmargin=15
.Pe
.PP
There are also three options that control how
.CW vi
acts in conducting a search.
By default, it differentiates between uppercase and lowercase
(\fIfoo\fP does not match \fIFoo\fP),
wraps around to the beginning of the file during a search
(this means you can begin your search anywhere in the file
and still find all occurrences),
and recognizes wildcard characters when matching patterns.
The default settings that control these options are

Another useful option is
.CW shiftwidth .
This option was designed
to help programmers properly indent their programs,
but it can also be useful to writers.
The

All these commands leave you in insert mode.
After inserting text, remember to press
.I ESC
to escape back to command mode.
.PP
The
.CW A
(\c
.I append )
and
.CW I
(\c
.I insert )
commands save you from having to move the cursor
to the end or beginning of the line
before invoking insert mode.
For example,
.CW A
saves one keystroke over
.CW $a .
Although one keystroke might not seem like a timesaver,
as you become a more adept
(and impatient) editor,
you'll want to omit any unnecessary keystrokes.
.PP
There are other combinations of commands
that work together naturally.
For example,
.CW ea
is useful for appending new text to the end of a word.
(It sometimes helps to train yourself
to recognize such frequent combinations
so that invoking them becomes automatic).
.Ah "Using Buffers
.LP 0
While you are editing,
you have seen that your last deletion
(\c
.CW d
or
.CW x )
or yank (
.CW y )
is saved in a buffer (a place in stored memory).
You can access the contents of that buffer
and put the saved text back in your file
with the put command (\c
.CW p
or
.CW P ).
.PP
The last nine deletions are stored by
.CW vi
in
.I numbered
buffers.
You can access any of these numbered buffers
.ix %begin [vi] editor, numbered buffers %key vi editor, numbered buffers
to restore any (or all) of the last nine deletions.
You can also place yanks (copied text) in buffers
identified by
.I letters .
You can fill up to 26 buffers
(\c

with yanked text
and restore that text with a put command any time
in your editing session.
.ix [vi] editor, recovering deletions %key vi editor, recovering deletions
.ix [vi] editor, undoing last change %key vi editor, undoing last change

The

program also saves your last edit command
(insert, change, delete, or yank)
in a buffer.
Your last command is available to repeat
or undo with a single keystroke.
.Bh "Recovering Deletions
.LP 0
Being able to delete large blocks of text at a single bound
is all well and good,
but what if you mistakenly delete 53 lines that you need?
There is a way to recover any of your past nine deletions,
which are saved in numbered buffers.
The last deletion is saved in buffer 1;
the second-to-last in buffer 2,
and so on.
.PP
To recover a deletion,
type
.CW \(dq
(quotation mark),
identify the buffered text by number, and then give the put command.
For example,
to recover your second-to-last deletion from buffer 2, type:
.Ps
"2p
.Pe
.ix [vi] editor, showing contents~of numbered~buffers %key vi editor, showing contents of numbered~buffers
.PP
Sometimes it's hard to remember
what's in the last nine buffers.
Here's a trick that can help.
.PP
The
.CW \.
command (repeat last command)
has a special meaning when used with
.CW p
and
.CW u .
The
.CW p
command will print the last deletion or change,
but
.CW 2p
will print the last two.
By combining
.CW p ,
.CW \&.
(dot),
and
.CW u
(undo),
you can step back through the numbered buffers.
.PP
The
.CW \(dq1p
command will put the last deletion,
now stored in buffer 1, back into your text.
If you then type
.CW u ,
it will go away.
But when you type the
.CW \&.
command,
instead of repeating the last command (\c
.CW \(dq1p ),
it will show the next buffer as if you'd typed
.CW \(dq2p .
You can thus step back through the buffers.
For example, the sequence:
.Ps
"1pu.u.u.u.u.
.Pe
will show you, in sequence, the contents of the last six numbered buffers.
.ix %begin [vi] editor, named buffers %key vi editor, named buffers
.Bh "Yanking to Named Buffers
.LP 0
With unnamed buffers,
you have seen that you must put
(\c
.CW p
or
.CW P )
the contents of the buffer before making any other edit,
or the buffer is overwritten.
You can also use
.CW y
with a set of 26 named buffers
(\fIa\fP through \fIz\fP),
which are specifically for copying and moving text.
If you name a buffer to store the yanked text,
you can place the contents of the named buffer
at any time during your editing session.
.ix %end [vi] editor, numbered buffers %key vi editor, numbered buffers
.PP
To yank into a named buffer,
precede the yank command with a quotation mark (\c
.CW \(dq )
and the character for the name of the buffer you want to load.
For example:
.RS
.IP \f(CW"dyy 10
yank current line into buffer \fId\fP
.IP \f(CW"a6yy 10
yank next six lines into buffer \fIa\fP
.RE
.PP
After loading the named buffers and moving to the new position,
use
.CW p
or
.CW P
to put the text back.
.RS
.IP \f(CW"dP 10
put buffer \fId\fP before cursor
.IP \f(CW"ap 10
put buffer \fIa\fP after cursor

There is no way to put part of a buffer
into the text\(emit is all or nothing.
.PP
Named buffers allow you to make other edits
before placing the buffer with
.CW p .
After you know how to travel between files
without leaving
.CW vi ,
you can use named buffers to selectively transfer text between files.
.PP
You can also delete text into named buffers,
using much the same procedure.
For example:
.RS
.IP \f(CW"a5dd 10
delete five lines into buffer \fIa\fP
.RE
.LP
If you specify the buffer name with a capital letter,
yanked or deleted text
will be
.I appended
to the current contents of the buffer.
For example:
.RS
.IP \f(CW"byy 10
yank current line into buffer \fIb\fP
.IP \f(CW"B5dd 10
delete five lines and append to buffer \fIb\fP
.IP \f(CW3} 10
move down three paragraphs
.IP \f(CW"bP 10
insert the six lines from buffer \fIb\fP above the cursor
.RE
.LP
When you put text from a named buffer,
a copy still remains in that buffer;
you can repeat the put as often as you like
until you quit your editing session
or replace the text in the buffer.
.PP
For example, suppose you were preparing a document
with some repetitive elements,
such as the skeleton for each page
of the reference section in a manual.
You could store the skeleton in a named buffer,
put it into your file,
fill in the blanks,
then put the skeleton in again each time you need it.

.Ah "Marking Your Place
.LP 0
During a
.CW vi
session, you can mark your place in the file
with an invisible \(lqbookmark,\(rq
perform edits elsewhere,
then return to your marked place.
In the command mode:
.RS
.IP \f(CW"m\fIx\fP 10
marks current position with \fIx\fP (\fIx\fP can be any letter)
.IP \f(CW"\'\fIx\fP 10
moves cursor to beginning of line marked by \fIx\fP
.IP \f(CW"\`\fIx\fP 10
moves cursor to character marked by \fIx\fP
.IP \f(CW"\`\` 10
returns to previous mark or context after a move

.Ah "Other Advanced Edits
.LP 0
You may wonder why we haven't discussed global changes,
moving text between files,
.ix [vi] editor, moving text %key vi editor, moving text
or other advanced
.CW ex
topics.
The reason is that, to use these tools,
it helps to learn more about
.CW ex
and a set of UNIX pattern-matching tools
that we discuss together in Chapter 7.
