.LP
.page 387
.ix %begin [awk] %key awk
A program is a solution to a problem, formulated in the
syntax of a particular language.
It is a small step from writing
complex editing scripts with
.CW sed
to writing programs with
.CW awk ,
but it is a step that many writers may fear to take.
\(lqScript\(rq is less loaded a term than
\(lqprogram\(rq for many people,
but an editing script is still a program.
.PP
Each programming language has its own \(lqstyle\(rq that
lends itself to performing certain tasks better
than other languages.
Anyone can scan a reference page and
quickly learn a language's syntax,
but a close examination of programs written in that language
is usually required before you understand how to apply this
knowledge.
In this sense, a programming language is simply
another tool; you need to know not only how to use it but also
when and why it is used.
.PP
We recommend that you learn more than one programming
language.
We have already looked at a number of different
programs or scripts written for and executed by the shell,
.CW ex ,
and
.CW sed .
As you learn the
.CW awk
programming language, you will
notice similarities and differences.
.ix [awk], similarities~to [sed] %key awk, similarities to [sed]
Not insignificantly, an
.CW awk
script looks different from a shell script.
The
.CW awk
language shares many of the same basic constructs as the
shell's programming language, yet
.CW awk
requires a slightly different syntax.
The
.CW awk
program's basic operations are not
.ix [awk], basic operations %key awk, basic operations
much different from
.CW sed 's:
reading standard input one line
at a time, executing instructions that consist of two parts,
.I pattern
and
.I procedure ,
and writing to standard output.
.PP
More importantly,
.CW awk
has capabilities that make it the tool
.ix [awk], capabilities~of %key awk, capabilities of
of choice for certain tasks.
A programming language is itself
a program that was written to solve certain kinds of problems
for which adequate tools did not exist.
The
.CW awk
program was designed for text-processing applications,
particularly those
in which information is structured in records and fields.
The major capabilities of
.CW awk
that we will demonstrate in upcoming pages are as follows:
.RS
.Ls B
.Li
definable record and field structure
.Li
conditional and looping constructs
.page 388
.Li
assignment, arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
.Li
numeric and associative arrays
.Li
formatted print statements
.Li
built-in functions
.Le
.RE
.LP
A quick comparison of a single feature will show you how one
programming language can differ from another.
You will find it
much easier to perform arithmetic operations in
.CW awk
than in the shell.
To increment the value of
.CW x
by 1 using the shell, you'd use the following line:
.Ps
x=`expr $x + 1`
.Pe
.LP
The
.CW expr
.ix [expr] command %key expr command
command is a UNIX program that is executed as a
separate process returning the value of its arguments.
In
.CW awk ,
you only have to write:
.Ps
++x
.Pe
.LP
This is the same as
.CW "x = x + 1" .
(This form could also be used in
.CW awk ).
.Ah "Invoking \f(CBawk\fP
.ix %begin [awk], invoking %key awk, invoking
.LP
The
.CW awk
program itself is a program that, like
.CW sed ,
runs a specified program on lines of input.
You can enter
.CW awk
from the command line, or from inside a shell script.
.Ps
$ \f(CB]awk\fP '\f[I]program\fP' \f[I]files\fP
.Pe
.LP
Input is read a line at a time from one or more
.I files .
The
.I program ,
enclosed in single quotation marks to protect it
from the shell, consists of
.I pattern
and
.I procedure
sections.
If the pattern is missing, the procedure is performed on all
input lines:
.ix [awk], pattern matching %key awk, pattern matching
.Ps
.ta 3i
$ \f[CB]awk '{print}' sample\fP	\fIPrints all lines in \fPsample \f[I]file\fP
.TA
.Pe
.LP
The procedure is placed within braces.
If the procedure is
missing, lines matching the pattern are printed:
.Ps
.ta 3i
$ \f[CB]awk '/programmer's guide/' sample\fP	\fIPrints lines matching pattern
		in \fPsample \f[I]file\fP
.TA
.Pe
.PP
The
.CW awk
program allows you to specify zero, one, or two
pattern addresses, just like
.CW sed .
Regular expressions are
placed inside a pair of slashes (/).
In
.CW awk ,
patterns can
also be made up of expressions.
An expression (or a primary
expression so as not to confuse it with a regular expression)
can be a string or numeric constant (for example,
.I red
or
.I 1 ),
a variable (whose value is a string or numeric), or a function
(which we'll look at later).
.PP
You can associate a pattern with a specific procedure as follows:
.Ps
	/pattern1/ {
			procedure1
		}
	/pattern2/ {
			procedure2
		}
.page 389
	{ procedure 3 }
.Pe
.LP
Like
.CW sed ,
only the lines matching the particular pattern are
the object of a procedure, and a line can match more than one
pattern.
In this example, the third procedure is performed on
all input lines.
Usually, multi-line
.CW awk
scripts are placed
in a separate file and invoked using the
.CW -f
option:
.Ps
$ \f[CB]awk -f awkscript sample\fP
.ix %end [awk], invoking %key awk, invoking
.Pe
.Ah "Records and Fields
.ix records, in [awk] %key records, in awk
.ix %begin fields, in [awk] %key fields, in awk
.LP
Perhaps the most important feature of
.CW awk
is that it divides
each line of input into fields.
.ix [awk], dividing~input~into records~and~fields %key awk, dividing input~into records~and~fields
In the simplest case, each field contains a
single word, delimited by a blank space.
The
.CW awk
program allows you to reference these fields
by their position in the input line,
either in patterns or procedures.
The symbol
.CW $0
represents the entire input line.
.CW $1 ,
.CW $2 ,
.CW ...
refer, by their position in the input line,
to individual fields.
.PP
We'll demonstrate some of these capabilities by building an
.CW awk
program to search through a list of acronyms in a file.
Each acronym is listed along with its meaning.
If we print the first field of each line,
we'll get the name of the acronym:
.Ps
$ \f(CBawk '{print $1}' sample\fP
BASIC
CICS
COBOL
DBMS
GIGO
GIRL
.Pe
.LP
We can construct a useful program that would allow you to
specify an acronym and get its description.
We could use
.CW awk
just like
.CW grep :
.Ps
$ \f(CBawk '/BASIC/' sample\fP
BASIC Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code
.Pe
.LP
However, there are three things we'd like to do to improve
this program and make better use of
.CW awk 's
capabilities:
.RS
.Ls
.Li
Limit the pattern-matching search.
.Li
Make the program more general and not dependent on the
particular acronym that is the subject of the search.
.Li
Print only the description.
.Le
.RE
.page 390
.Ah "Testing Fields
.ix [awk], testing fields %key awk, testing fields
.LP
The pattern as specified will match the word
.I BASIC
anywhere on the line.
That is, it might match
.I BASIC
used in a description.
To see if the first field
.CW $1 ) (
matches the pattern, we write:
.Ps
$1 == "BASIC"
.Pe
.LP
The symbol
.CW ==
is a relational operator meaning \(lqequal to\(rq and is
used to compare the first field of each line with the string
.I BASIC .
You could also construct this test using a given
regular expression that looks for the acronym at
the beginning of the line.
.Ps
$1 ~ /^BASIC/
.Pe
.LP
The pattern-matching operator
.CW ~
evaluates as true if an expression
.CW $1 ) (
matches a regular expression.
Its opposite,
.CW !~ ,
evaluates true if the expression does not match the
regular expression.
.PP
Although these two examples look very similar, they achieve
very different results.
The relational operator
.CW ==
evaluates true if the first field is
.I BASIC
but false if the first field is
.I BASIC,
(note the comma).
The pattern-matching operator
.CW ~
locates both occurrences.
.PP
Pattern-matching operations must be performed on a regular
expression (a string surrounded by slashes).
Variables cannot be used inside a regular expression
with the exception of shell variables,
as shown in the next section.
Constants cannot be evaluated using the pattern-matching operator.
.Ah "Passing Parameters from a Shell Script
.ix [awk], passing parameters~from~a shell~script %key awk, passing parameters from~a shell~script
.LP
Our program is too specific and requires too much typing.
We can put the
.CW awk
script in a file and invoke it with the
.CW -f
option.
Or we can put the command inside a shell script,
named for the function it performs.
This shell script should
be able to read the first argument from the command line (the
name of the acronym) and pass it as a parameter to
.CW awk .
We'll call the shell script
.CW awkronym
.ix [awk], [awkronym] script %key awk, [awkronym] script
.ix %begin [awk], [awkronym] script %key awk, [awkronym] script
and set it up to read a file
named
.CW acronyms .
Here's the simplest way to pass an argument into an
.CW awk
procedure:
.Ps
$ \f[CB]cat awkronym\fP
awk '$1 == search' search=$1 acronyms
.Pe
.LP
Parameters passed to an
.CW awk
program are specified
.I after
the program.
The search variable is set up to pass the first
argument on the command line to the
.CW awk
program.
Even this gets confusing, because
.CW $1
inside the
.CW awk
program represents the first field of each input line, while
.CW $1
in the shell
represents the first argument supplied on the command line.
Here's how this version of the program works:
.Ps
$ \f(CBawkronym CICS\fP
CICS Customer Information Control System
.Pe
.LP
By replacing the search string
.CW BASIC
with a variable (which
could be set to the string
.CW CICS
or
.CW BASIC ),
we have a program that is fairly generalized.
.page 391
.PP
Notice that we had to test the parameter as a string
.CW "$1 == search" ). (
This is because we can't pass the parameter inside
a regular expression.
Thus, the expressions
.CW "$1 ~ /search/" '' ``
or
.CW "$1 ~ search" '' ``
will produce syntax errors.
.PP
As an aside, let's look at another way to import a shell
variable into an
.CW awk
program that even works inside a regular expression.
However, it looks complicated:
.Ps
search=$1
awk '$1 ~ /'"$search"'/' acronyms
.Pe
.LP
This program works the same as the prior version (with the
exception that the argument is evaluated inside a regular
expression).
Note that the first line of the script makes the
variable assignment before
.CW awk
is invoked.
In the
.CW awk
program, the shell variable is enclosed within single,
then double, quotation marks.
These quotes cause the shell to insert the value of
.CW $search
inside the regular expression before it is interpreted by
.CW awk .
Therefore,
.CW awk
never sees the shell
variable and evaluates it as a constant string.
.PP
You will come upon situations when you
wish it were possible to place
.CW awk
variables within regular expressions.
As mentioned
in the previous section, pattern matching allows us to search
for a variety of occurrences.
For instance, a field might also
include incidental punctuation marks and would not match a fixed
string unless the string included the specific punctuation mark.
Perhaps there is some undocumented way of getting an
.CW awk
variable interpreted inside a regular expression, or maybe
there is a convoluted work-around waiting to be figured out.
.ix %end fields, in [awk] %key fields, in awk
.Ah "Changing the Field Separator
.ix [awk], changing~the field~separator %key awk, changing the field~separator
.LP
The
.CW awk
program is oriented toward data arranged in fields and records.
A record is normally a single line of input,
consisting of one or more fields.
The field separator is a
blank space or tab and the record separator is a newline.
For example, here's one record with five fields:
.Ps
CICS Customer Information Control System
.Pe
.LP
Field three or
.CW $3
is the string
.I Information .
In our program,
we like to be able to print the description as a field.
It is obvious that we can't just say
.CW "print $2"
and get the entire description.
But that is what we'd like to be able to do.
.PP
This will require that we change the input file using another
character (other than a blank) to delimit fields.
A tab is frequently used as a field separator.
We'll have to insert a
tab between the first and second fields:
.Ps
$ \f(CBcat acronyms\fP
.ta .5i
awk	Aho, Weinstein & Kernighan
BASIC	Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code
CICS	Customer Information Control System
COBOL	Common Business Orientated Language
DBMS	Data Base Management System
GIGO	Garbage In, Garbage Out
GIRL	Generalized Information Retrieval Language
.TA
.Pe
.page 392
.LP
You can change the field separator from the command line using
the -F option:
.Ps
$ \f[CB]awk -F"|\(em\(em|" '$1 == search {print $2}' search=$1 acronyms\fP
.Pe
.LP
Note that
.CW |\(em\(em|
is entered by typing a double quotation
mark, pressing the
.I TAB
key, and typing a double quotation mark.
This makes the tab character (represented in the example as
.CW |\(em\(em| )
the exclusive field separator; spaces no longer
serve to separate fields.
Now that we've implemented all three
enhancements, let's see how the program works:
.Ps
$ \f(CBawkronym GIGO\fP
Garbage In, Garbage Out
.Pe
.Ah "System Variables
.ix [awk], system variables %key awk, system variables
.LP
The
.CW awk
program defines a number of special variables that
can be referenced or reset inside a program.
See Table 13-1.
.Ts "\f(CBawk\fP System Variables
.TS
center box;
l c
lf(CW) l.
System Variable	Meaning
_
FILENAME	Current filename
FS	Field separator (a blank)
NF	Number of fields in the current record
NR	Number of the current record
OFS	Output field separator (a blank)
ORS	Output record separator (a newline)
RS	Record separator (a newline)
.TE
.Te
.PP
The system variable
.CW FS
defines the field separator used by
.CW awk .
You can set
.CW FS
inside the program as well as from the command line.
.PP
Typically, if you redefine the field or record separator,
it is done as part of a
.CW BEGIN
procedure.
.ix [awk], [BEGIN] procedures %key awk, [BEGIN] procedures
The
.CW BEGIN
procedure allows you to specify an action that is performed
before the first input line is read.
.Ps
BEGIN { FS = "|\(em\(em|" }
.Pe
.LP
You can also specify actions that are performed after all
input is read by defining an
.CW END
procedure.
.PP
The
.CW awk
command sets the variable
.ix %end [awk], [awkronym] script %key awk, [awkronym] script
.CW NF
to the number of fields on the current line.
Try running the following
.CW awk
command on any text file:
.Ps
$ \f[CB]awk '{print $NF}' test\fP
.Pe
.LP
If there are five fields in the current record,
.CW NF
will be set to five;
.CW $NF
refers to the fifth and last field.
Shortly, we'll look at a program,
.CW double ,
that makes good use of this variable.
.page 393
.Ah Looping
.LP
The
.CW awkronym
program can print field two because we restructured
the input file and redefined the field separator.
Sometimes, this isn't practical,
and you need another method to read
or print a number of fields for each record.
If the field separator is a blank or tab,
the two records would have six and five fields, respectively.
.Ps
BASIC Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code
CICS Customer Information Control System
.Pe
.LP
It is not unusual for records to have a variable number
of fields.
To print all but the first field, our program
would require a loop that would be repeated as many times as
there are fields remaining.
In many
.CW awk
programs, a loop is a commonly used procedure.
.PP
The
.CW while
.ix [awk], [while]~loops %key awk, [while] loops
statement can be employed to build a loop.
For instance, if we want to perform a procedure three times,
we keep track of how many times we go through the loop by
incrementing a variable at the bottom of the loop, then we
check at the top of the loop to see if that variable is greater
than 3.
Let's take an example in which we print
the input line three times.
.Ps
{	i = 1
	while (i <= 3) {
		print
		++i
		}
	}
.Pe
.LP
Braces are required inside the loop to describe a procedure
.ix expression operators, in~[awk] %key expression operators, in awk
consisting of more than a single action.
Three operators are used in this program:
.CW =
assigns the value 1 to the variable
.CW i ;
.CW <=
compares the value of
.CW i
to the constant 3; and
.CW ++
increments the variable by 1.
The first time the
.CW while
statement is encountered,
.CW i
is equal to 1.
Because the expression
.CW "i <= 3"
is true, the procedure is performed.
The last action of the procedure is to increment the variable
.CW i .
The
.CW while
expression is true after the end of
the second loop has incremented
.CW i
to 3.
However, the end of the third loop increments
.CW i
to 4 and the expression evaluates as false.
.PP
A
.CW for
loop serves the same purpose as a
.ix [awk], [for]~loops %key awk, [for] loops
.CW while
loop, but its syntax is more compact
and easier to remember and use.
Here's how the previous
.CW while
statement is restructured as a
.CW for
loop:
.Ps
for (i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
	print
.Pe
.LP
The
.CW for
statement consists of three expressions within
parentheses.
The first expression,
.CW "i = 1" ,
sets the initial
value for the counter variable.
The second expression states
a condition that is tested at the top of the loop.
(The
.CW while
statement tested the condition at the bottom of the loop).
The third expression increments the counter.
.PP
Now, to loop through remaining fields on the line, we have
to determine how
many times we need to execute the loop.
The system variable
.CW NF
contains the number of fields on the current input record.
If we compare our counter
.CW i ) (
against
.CW NF
each time through the
loop, we'll be able to tell when all fields have been read:
.page 394
.Ps
for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++)
.Pe
.LP
We will print out each field
.CW $i ), (
one to a line.
Just to show how
.CW awk
works, we'll print the record and field number before each field.
.Ps
awk '{ for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++)
	print NR":"i, $i } ' $*
.Pe
.LP
Notice that the print statement concatenates
.CW NR ,
a colon, and
.CW i .
The comma produces an output field separator, which is
a blank by default.
.PP
This program produces the following results on a sample file:
.Ps
1:1 awk
1:2 Aho,
1:3 Weinstein
1:4 &
1:5 Kernighan
2:1 BASIC
2:2 Beginner's
2:3 All-Purpose
2:4 Symbolic
2:5 Instruction
2:6 Code
.Pe
.LP
.CW Symbolic
is the fourth field of the second record.
You might note that the sample file is
.CW acronyms ,
the one in which we inserted a tab character
between the first and second fields.
Because we did not change the default field separator,
.CW awk
interpreted the tab or blank as a field separator.
This allows you to write programs in which
the special value of the tab is ignored.
.Bh "Conditional Statements
.ix [awk], conditional statements %key awk, conditional statements
.ix conditional execution, in~[awk] %key conditional execution, in awk
.LP
Now let's change our example so that when given an argument,
the program returns the record and field number where that
argument appears.
.PP
Essentially, we want to test each field to see
if it matches the argument;
if it does, we want to print the record and field number.
We need to introduce another flow control construct, the
.CW if
statement.
The
.CW if
statement evaluates an expression\(emif
true, it performs the procedure; if false, it does not.
.PP
In the next example, we use the
.CW if
statement to test whether
the current field is equal to the argument.
If it is, the current record and field number are printed.
.Ps
awk '{ for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
	if ($i == search) {
		print NR":"i
		}
	}
} ' search=$1 acronyms
.Pe
.LP
This new procedure prints
.I 2:1
or
.I 3:4
and isn't very useful
by itself, but it demonstrates that you can retrieve and test
any single field from any record.
.page 395
.PP
The next program,
.CW double ,
.ix proofreading, double [awk]~script %key proofreading, double awk script
checks if the first word on a line is a duplicate of
the last word on the previous line.
We use
.CW double
in proofing documents and it catches a
surprisingly common typing mistake.
.Ps
awk '
NF > 0 {
	if ($1 == lastword) {
		print NR ": double " $1
		}
		lastword = $NF
}' $1
.Pe
.LP
When the first line of input is read, if the number of fields
is greater than 0, then the expression in the
.CW if
statement is evaluated.
Because the variable
.CW lastword
has not been set, it evaluates to false.
The final action assigns the value of
.CW $NF
to the variable
.CW lastword .
.CW $NF "" (
refers to the last field; the value of
.CW NF
is the number of the last field).
When the next input line is read,
the first word is compared against the value of
.CW lastword .
If they are the same, a message is printed.
.Ps
double sect1
15: double the
32: double a
.Pe
.LP
This version of
.CW double
is based on the program presented
by Kernighan and Pike in
.I "The UNIX Programming Environment" .
(Writer's Workbench now includes this program).
Kernighan and Pike's program also checks for duplicate words,
.ix Kernighan~and~Pike, {UNIX~Programming~Environment} %key Kernighan and~Pike, UNIX~Programming~Environment
side-by-side, in the same line.
You might try implementing this enhancement, using a
.CW for
loop and checking the current field against the previous field.
Another feature of Kernighan and Pike's
.CW double
is that you can run the program on more than one file.
To allow for additional files, you can change the shell variable
from
.CW $1
to
.CW $*
but the record or line number printed by
.CW NR
will correspond to consecutive input lines.
Can you write a procedure to reset
.CW NR
to 0 before reading input from a new file?
.Bh Arrays
.ix [awk], arrays %key awk, arrays
.LP
The
.CW double
program shows us how we can retain data by assigning
it to a variable.
.ix [awk], variables %key awk, variables
In
.CW awk ,
unlike several other programming
languages, variables do not have to be initialized before
they are referenced in a program.
In the previous program, we evaluated
.CW lastword
at the top, although it was not actually
assigned a value until the bottom of the program.
The
.CW awk
program initialized the variable, setting it to the null string
or 0, depending upon whether the variable is referenced as a
string or numeric value.
.PP
An array is a variable that allows
you to store a list of items or elements.
An array is analogous to a restaurant menu.
Each item on this menu is numbered:
.DS I
	#1	tuna noodle casserole

	#2	roast beef and gravy

	#3	pork and beans
.DE
.page 396
.LP
One way of ordering roast beef is to say simply
\(lqNumber 2.\(rq
Using ordinary variables, you would have had to define a
variable
.I two
and assign it the value
.I "roast beef and gravy" .
An array is a way of referencing a group of related values.
This might be written:
.Ps
	menu[choice]
.Pe
.LP
where
.CW menu
is the name of the array and
.CW choice
is the
.I subscript
used to reference items in the array.
Thus,
.CW menu[1]
is equal
to
.I "tuna noodle casserole" .
In
.CW awk ,
you don't have to declare
the size of the array; you only have to load the
array (before referencing it).
If we put our three menu choices on separate
lines in a file, we could load the array with the following
statement:
.Ps
menu[NR] = $0
.Pe
.LP
The variable
.CW NR ,
or record number, is used as the subscript for the array.
Each input line is read into the next element in the array.
We can print an individual element by referring to the
value of the subscript (not the variable that set this value).
.Ps
print menu[3]
.Pe
.LP
This statement prints the third element
in the array, which is
.I "pork and beans" .
If we want to refer to all the elements of
this array, we can use a special version of the
.ix [awk], [for]~loops~with arrays %key awk, [for] loops~with arrays
.CW for
loop.
It has the following syntax:
.Ps
for (\fIelement\fP in \fIarray\fP)
.Pe
.LP
This statement can be used to descend the array to print all
of the elements:
.Ps
for (choice in menu)
	print menu[choice]
.Pe
.LP
Each time through the loop, the variable
.CW choice
is set to the next element in the array.
The
.CW menu
array is an example of an
array that uses a numeric subscript as an index to the elements.
.ix %begin [awk], [awkronym] script %key awk, [awkronym] script
.PP
Now, let's use arrays to increase the functionality of
.CW awkronym .
Our new version will read acronyms from a file
and load them into an array; then we'll read a second file
and search for the acronyms.
Basically, we're reading one
input file and defining keywords that we want to search for
in other files.
A similar program that reads a list of terms
in a glossary might show where the words appear in a chapter.

.PP
Let's look at the program carefully.
.page 397
.Ps
awk ' {
if ( FILENAME == "acronyms" ) {
	acro_desc[NR] = $1
	next
	}
for ( name in acro_desc )
	for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++)
		if ($i == acro_desc[name] ) {
			print $0
			}
}' acronyms $*
.Pe
.LP
The current filename is stored in the system variable
.CW FILENAME .
The procedure within the first conditional statement is only
performed while input is taken from
.CW acronyms .
The
.CW next
statement ends this procedure by
reading the next line of input from the file.
Thus, the program does not advance beyond this procedure
until input is taken from a different file.
.PP
The purpose of the first procedure is to assign each acronym
.CW $1 ) (
to an element of the array
.CW acro_desc ;
the record number
.CW NR ) (
indexes the array.
.PP
In the second half of the program, we start comparing each
element in the array to each field of every record.
This requires two
.CW for
loops, one to cycle through the array for each input line,
and one to read each field on that line for as
many times as there are elements in the array.
An
.CW if
statement compares the current field to
the current element of the array;
if they are equal, then the line is printed.
.PP
The line is printed each time an acronym is found.
In our test example, because there were
two acronyms on a single line, the one line is duplicated.
To change this, we could add
.CW next
after the
.CW print
statement.
.PP
What if we changed
.CW awkronym
so that it not only scanned
the file for the acronym, but printed the acronym with the
description as well?
If a line refers to
.I BASIC ,
we'd like
to add the description
.I "Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code" ). (
We can design such a program for use as a
.I filter
that prints all lines, regardless of whether or
not a change has been made.
To change the previous version,
we simply move the
.CW print
statement outside the conditional statement.
However, there are other changes we must make as well.
Here's the first part of the new version.
.Ps
awk ' {
	if ( FILENAME == "acronyms" ) {
	split ( $0, fields, "|\(em\(em|" )
	acro_desc[fields[1]] = fields[2]
	next
	}
.Pe
.LP
The records in
.CW acronyms
use a tab as a field separator.
Rather than change the field separator, we use the
.CW split
function (we'll look at the syntax of this function later on)
to give us an array named
.CW fields
that has two elements, the name of
the acronym and its description.
This numeric array is then
used in creating an associative array named
.CW acro_desc .
An associative array lets us use a string as a subscript to the
elements of an array.
That is, given the name of the acronym, we can locate the element
.page 398
corresponding to the description.
Thus the expression
.CW acro_desc[GIGO]
will access
.CW "Garbage In, Garbage Out" .
.PP
Now let's look at the second half of the program:
.Ps
for ( name in acro_desc )
	for (i = 1 ; i <= NF; i++)
		if ( $i == name) {
			$i = $i " ("acro_desc[name]")"
		}
print $0
.Pe
.PP
Just like the previous version, we loop through the elements
of the array and the fields for each record.
At the heart of this section is the conditional statement
that tests if the current field
.CW $i ) (
is equal to the subscript of the array
.CW name ). (
If the value of the field and the subscript are equal,
we concatenate the field and the array element.
In addition, we place the description in parentheses.
.PP
It should be clear why we make the comparison between
.CW $i
and
.CW name ,
and not
.CW acro_desc[name] ;
the latter refers to an element, while the
former refers to the subscript, the name of the acronym.
.PP
If the current field
.CW $i ) (
equals
.CW BASIC
and the index of the array
.CW name ) (
is the string
.I BASIC ,
then the value of the field is set to:
.Ps
BASIC  (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)
.Pe
.PP
For this program to be practical, the description should be
inserted for the first occurrence of an acronym, not each time.
(After we've inserted the description of the acronym, we don't
need the description any more).
We could redefine that element
in the array after we've used it.
.Ps
acro_desc[name] = name
.Pe
.LP
In this instance, we simply make the element equal
to the subscript.
Thus,
.CW acro_desc[BASIC]
is equal to
.I "Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code"
at the beginning of the procedure, and equal to
.I BASIC
if a match has been made.
There are two places where we test the element
against the subscript with the expression
.CW "(acro_desc[name] != name)" .'' ``
The first place is after the
.CW for
loop has read in a new element from
.CW acro_desc ;
a conditional statement ensures
that we don't scan the next input record for an acronym that
has already been found.
The second place is when we test
.CW $i
to see if it matches name; this test ensures that we don't
make another match for the same acronym on that line.
.Ps
if ( $i == name && acro_desc[name] != name)
.Pe
.LP
This conditional statement evaluates a compound expression.
The
.CW &&
(and) boolean operator states a condition that both
expressions have to be true for the compound expression to
be true.
.PP
Another problem that we can anticipate is that we might produce
lines that exceed 80 characters.
After all, the descriptions are quite long.
We can find out how many characters are in a
string, using a built-in
.CW awk
function,
.CW length .
For instance,
to evaluate the length of the current input record, we specify:
.page 399
.Ps
length($0)
.Pe
.LP
The value of a function can be assigned to a variable or put
inside an expression and evaluated.
.Ps
if ( length($0) > 70 ) {
	if ( i > 2 )
		$i = "\\n" $i
	if ( i+1 < NF )
		$(i+1) = "\\n" $(i+1)
	}
.Pe
.LP
The length of the current input record is evaluated after the
description has been concatenated.
If it is greater than 70 characters,
then two conditions test where to put the newline.
The first procedure concatenates a newline and the
current field; thus we only want to perform this action when we
are not near the beginning of a line (field greater than 2).
The second procedure concatenates the newline and the next
field
.CW (i+1)
so that we check that we are not near the end of the line.
The newline precedes the field in each of these operations.
Putting it at the end of the field would result in
a new line that begins with a space output with the next field.
.PP
Another way to handle the line break, perhaps more efficiently,
is to use the
.CW length
function to return a value for each field.
By accumulating that value, we could specify a line break
when a new field causes the total to exceed a certain number.
We'll look at arithmetic operations in a later section.
.PP
Here's the full version of
.CW awkronyms :
.Ps
awk ' {
	if ( FILENAME == "acronyms" ) {
	split ( $0, fields, "|\(em\(em|" )
	acro_desc[fields[1]]=fields[2]
	next
	}
for ( name in acro_desc )
	if (acro_desc[name] != name)
	for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++)
		if ($i == name && acro_desc[name] != name) {
		$i = $i " ("acro_desc[name]")"
		acro_desc[name] = name
		if (length ($0) > 70) {
			if (i > 2)
				$i = "\\n" $i
			if (i+1 < NF)
				$(i+1) = "\\n" $(i+1)
		}
	}
print $0
}' acronyms $*

command displays the prompt on the user's terminal;
.CW \ec
suppresses the carriage return at the end of the prompt.
The
.CW read
command waits for user input, terminated by
a carriage return, and assigns it to a variable.
Thus, the variables
.CW proj

There are four fields, separated by tabs.

The program performs the arithmetic tasks well, but the
report lacks an orderly format.
It would help to change the output field separator (OFS)
to a tab.
But the variable
lengths of the project names prevent the project hours from
being aligned in a single column.
The
.CW awk
program offers an alternative print statement,
.CW printf ,
which is borrowed from the C programming language.
.Bh "Formatted Print Statements

The
.CW printf
statement has two parts: the first is a quoted
expression that describes the format specifications; the
second is a sequence of arguments such as variable names.
The two main format specifications are
.CW %s
for strings and
.CW %d
for decimals.
(There are additional specifications for octal,
hexadecimal, and non-integer numbers).
Unlike the regular
.CW print
statement,
.CW printf
does not automatically supply a newline.
This can be specified as
.CW \en .
A tab is specified as
.CW \et .
.page 403

A simple
.CW printf
statement containing string and decimal
specifications is:
.Ps
printf "%s\\t%d\\n" , project, hours[project]
.Pe

First
.CW project
is output, then a tab
.CW \et ), (
the number of hours, and a newline
.CW \en ). (
For each format specification, you must
supply a corresponding argument.

Unfortunately, such a simple statement does not solve our
formatting problem.
Here are sample lines that it produces:

We need to specify a minimum field width so that the tab
begins at the same position.
The
.CW printf
statement allows you to place this specification between the

and the conversion specification.
You would use
.CW %-20s
to specify a minimum field
width of 20 characters in which the value is left justified.
Without the minus sign, the value would be right justified,
which is what we want for a decimal value.

Notice that literals, such as the string

.Bh "Defensive Techniques
.LP
After you have accomplished the basic task of
a program\(emand the code at this point is fairly
easy to understand\(emit is often a good idea
to surround this core with \(lqdefensive\(rq
procedures designed to trap inconsistent input
records and prevent the program from failing.
For instance, in the
.CW tot
program, we might want to check that the number of hours
is greater than 0 and that the project description is not null
for each input record.
We can use a conditional expression, using the logical operator
.CW && .
.Ps
$3 > 0 && $4 != "" {
					procedure
				}
.Pe
.LP
Both conditions must be true for the procedure to be executed.
The logical operator
.CW &&
signifies that if both conditions are true, the expression
is true.
.PP
Another aspect of incorporating defensive techniques is error
.ix [awk], error handling~in %key awk, error handling in
handling.
In other words, what do we want to have happen after
the program detects an error?
The previous condition is set up so that if the procedure
is not executed, the next line of input is read.
In this example the program keeps going, but in
other cases you might want the program to print an error
message and halt if such an error is encountered.
.PP
However, a distinction between \(lqprofessional\(rq
and \(lqamateur\(rq programmers might be useful.
We are definitely in the latter camp, and
we do not always feel compelled to write 100% user-proof programs.
For one thing, defensive programming is quite
time consuming and frequently tedious.
Second, an amateur
is at liberty to write programs that perform the way he
or she expects them to; a professional has to write for an
audience and must account for their expectations.
Consider the possible uses and users of any program you write.

print ".ce"
print ".B "
print "PROJECT ACTIVITY REPORT"

As you can see,
.CW awk
doesn't mind if you mix
.CW print
and

for specifying literals, such as formatting codes,

These are multiline records, that is, a newline is used as the

Let's write a simple program that multiplies the number of
copies by the price.
We want to ignore the first two lines

order number, and the date of the order.
We only want to read the lines that specify a title.
There are a few ways to do this.

Now, let's design a program that reads multiline records and
accumulates order information for a report.
This report should display the total number of copies
and the total amount for each title.
We also want totals reflecting all copies ordered
and the sum of all orders.
.PP
We know that we will not be using the information in the
first two fields of each record.
However, each record has a variable number of fields,
depending upon how many titles have been ordered.
First, we check that the input record has
at least three fields.
Then a
.CW for
loop reads all of the fields
beginning with the third field:
.Ps
NF >= 3 {
for (i = 3; i <= NF; ++i)
.Pe
.LP
In database terms, each field has a value and each value can
be further broken up into subvalues.
That is, if the value of a
field in a multiline record is a single line, subvalues are the
words on that line.
You have already seen the
.CW split
function
used to break up an input record; now we'll see it used to
.ix [awk], subdividing~a field %key awk, subdividing a field

The
.CW split

.I array ,
using a specified character as the subvalue separator.
.Ps
split(\fIstring\fP, \fIarray\fP, \fIseparator\fP)
.Pe
.LP
The default subvalue separator is a blank.
The
.CW split
function returns the number of elements loaded into the array.
.ix [awk], arrays %key awk, arrays
The
.I string
can be a literal (in quotation marks) or a variable.
For instance, let's digress a minute and look at an isolated
use of
.CW split .
Here's a person's name and title with each part
separated by a comma:
.Ps
title="George Travers, Research/Development, Alcuin Inc."
.Pe
.LP
We can use
.CW split
to divide this string and print it on three lines.
.Ps
need = split (title, name, ",")
	print ".ne ", need
	for (part in name)
		print name[part]
.Pe
.LP
This procedure prints each part on a separate line.
The number
of elements in the array (3) is saved in the variable
.CW need .
This variable is passed as an argument to an
.CW .ne
request, which tells

The
.CW awk
program has twelve built-in functions, as shown in
Table 13-2.
Four of these are specialized arithmetic functions
for cosine, sine, logarithm, and square root.
The rest of these functions manipulate strings.
(You have already seen how the
.CW length
function works).
See
.pdfhref L -D AppendixA -- Appendix A
for the syntax of these functions.
.PP
Going back to our report generator, we need to split each field
into subvalues.
The variable
.CW $i
will supply the value of the
current field, subdivided as elements in the array
.CW order .
.Ps
sv = split ($i, order)
	if (sv == 3) {
		procedure
	}
	else print "Incomplete Record"

The number of elements returned by the function is saved in
the
.CW sv
variable.
This allows us to test that there are three subvalues.
If there are not, the
.CW else
statement is executed, printing the error message to the screen.
.PP
Next, we assign the individual elements of the array to a
specific variable.
This is mainly to make it easier to remember
what each element represents.
.Ps
title = order[1]
copies = order[2]
price = order[3]
.Pe
.LP
Then a group of arithmetic operations are performed on these
values.
.Ps
amount = copies * price
total_vol += copies
total_amt += amount
vol[title] += copies
amt[title] += amount
.Pe
.LP
These values are accumulated until the last input record is read.
The
.CW END
procedure prints the report.
.PP
Here's the complete program:
.Ps
awk ' BEGIN { FS = "\\n"; RS = "" }
NF >= 3 {
for (i = 3; i <= NF; ++i ) {
	sv = split ($i, order)
		if (sv == 3) {
			title = order[1]
			copies = order[2]
			price = order[3]
			amount = copies * price
			total_vol += copies
.page 409
			total_amt += amount
			vol[title] += copies
			amt[title] += amount
			}
		else print "Incomplete Record"
		}
}
	END {
		printf "%5s\\t%10s\\t%6s\\n\\n", "TITLE", \\
		"COPIES SOLD", "TOTAL"
		for (title in vol)
	printf "%5s\\t%10d\\t$%7.2f\\n", title, vol[title], \\
		amt[title]
		"printf" " "%s\\n", "-------------"
	printf "\\t%s%4d\\t$%7.2f\\n", "Total " , total_vol, total_amt}'

.Pe
.LP
In
.CW awk ,
arrays are one dimensional; a two-dimensional array
stores two elements indexed by the same subscript.
You can get a pseudo two-dimensional array in
.CW awk
by defining two arrays that have the same subscript.
We only need one
.ix [awk], [for]~loops %key awk, [for] loops
.CW for
loop to read both arrays.
.PP
The
.CW addemup
file, an order report generator, produces the
following output:
.Ps
$ \f(CBaddemup orders.today\fP
TITLE  COPIES SOLD	TOTAL

   #1           5  $  37.50
   #2           8  $  56.25
   #3           1  $   7.50
   #4           1  $   7.50
   #7           1  $   7.50

        Total  16  $ 116.25

After you solve a programming problem, you will find that you
can re-use that approach in other programs.
For instance, the method used in the
.CW awkronym
program to load acronyms into an
array could be applied in the current example to read the book
titles from a file and print them in the report.
Similarly, you can use variations of the same program
to print different reports.
The construction of the next program is similar to
the previous program.
Yet the content of the report is quite different.
.Ps
awk ' BEGIN { FS = "\\n" ; RS = ""
printf "%-15s\\t%10s\\t%6s\\n\\n", "CUSTOMER", "COPIES SOLD", \\
	"TOTAL"
	}
NF >= 3 {
customer = $1
	total_vol = 0
	total_amt = 0
.page 410
for (i = 3; i <= NF; ++i) {
	split ($i, order)
	title = order[1]
	copies = order[2]
	price = order[3]
	amount = copies * price
	total_vol += copies
	total_amt += amount
}
printf "\\t%s%4d\\t$%7.2f\\n", "Total ", total_vol, total_amt}'
}' $*
.Pe
.LP
In this program, named
.CW summary ,
we print totals for each customer order.
Notice that the variables
.CW total_vol
and
.CW total_amt
are reset to 0 whenever a new record is read.
In the previous program, these values
accumulated from one record to the next.
.PP
The
.CW summary
program, reading a multiline record, produces a
report that 1ists each record on a single line:
.Ps
$ \f[CB]summary orders\fP
CUSTOMER     COPIES SOLD   TOTAL

J. Andrews            7   $  52.50

.Ah "Testing Programs

.LP
Part of writing a program is designing one or more test cases.
Usually this means creating a sample input file.
It is a good idea to test a program at various stages of
development.
Each time you add a function, test it.
For instance, if you implement a conditional procedure, test that
the procedure is executed when the expression is true; test
what happens when it is false.
Program testing involves making sure that the syntax is correct
.I and
that the problem has been solved.
.PP
When
.CW awk
encounters syntax errors it will tell you that it is
\(lqbailing out.\(rq
Usually it will print the line number associated with the error.
Syntax errors can be caused
by a variety of mistakes, such as forgetting to quote strings
or to close a procedure with a brace.
Sometimes, it can be as minor as an extra blank space.
The
.CW awk
program's
.page 411
error messages are seldom helpful, and a persistent effort is
often required to uncover the fault.
.PP
You might even see a UNIX system error message, such as the
dreadful declaration:
.Ps
Segmentation fault-core dumped.
.Pe
.ix core dumps
.LP
Not to worry.
Although your program has failed badly, you have
not caused an earthquake or a meltdown.
An image of \(lqcore\(rq memory at the time of the error
is saved or dumped in a file named
.CW core .
Advanced programmers can use a debugging program to examine
this image and determine where in memory the fault occurred.
We just delete
.CW core
and re-examine our code.
.PP
Again, check each construct as you add it to the program.
If you wait until you have a large program, and it fails, you
will often have difficulty finding the error.
Not only that,
but you are likely to make unnecessary changes, fixing what's
not broken in an attempt to find out what is.
.PP
Checking that you have solved the problem you set out to tackle
is a much larger issue.
After you begin testing your program
on larger samples, you will undoubtedly uncover
\(lqexceptions\(rq, otherwise known as
.I bugs .
In testing the
.ix %begin [awk], [awkronym] script %key awk, [awkronym] script
.CW awkronym
program,
we discovered an exception where an acronym appeared as the
last word in the sentence.
It was not \(lqfound\(rq because of the
period ending the sentence.
That is,
.CW awk
found that
.I BASIC
and
.I BASIC.
were not equal.
This would not be a problem if we could
test the search string as a regular expression but we have to
test the array variable as a literal string.
.PP
Programming is chiefly pragmatic in its aims.
You must judge
whether or not specific problems merit writing a program or if
certain exceptions are important enough to adapt the general
program to account for them.
Sometimes, in large public programs
as well as small private ones, bugs just become part of the
program's known behavior, which the user is left to cope with
as best as he or she can.
The bug found in
.CW awkronym
is a common enough problem, so it is necessary to implement a fix.
.PP
The fix for the
.CW awkronym
bug does not involve
.CW awk
at all.
We run a
.CW sed
script before the
.CW awkronym
program to separate
punctuation marks from any word.
It converts a punctuation
mark to a field containing garbage characters.
Another script processes the
.CW awkronym
output and strips out these garbage characters.
The example below shows how both scripts are used
as bookends for the
.CW awkronym
program.
